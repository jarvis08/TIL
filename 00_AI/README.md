# Machine Learning

---

My goal is to develop AI Secretary like 'Jarvis' in movie 'Ironman'.

But now I'm concentrating on studying Computer Science.

May be since November, I will start to study mainly on ML and DL.

Before November, I will review and organize what I learned before whenever I have spare time.
